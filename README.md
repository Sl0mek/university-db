## Description

University-DB++, coded in C++, offers a comprehensive academic database solution. It handles student, faculty, and staff records, enabling storing, adding, displaying, searching, sorting, deleting, editing, and managing data with ease.

## Requirements

The program meets the following requirements:

- Storing student records with the following structure: Name, surname, address, index number, PESEL number, gender
- Adding new students
- Display of the entire database
- Search by last name
- Search by PESEL number
- Sorting by PESEL number
- Sort by last name
- Delete by PESEL
- Validation if the PESEL number is correct, according to [Wikipedia](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/PESEL#Cyfra_control) - correctness of PESEL
- Loading from a file and saving the entire database to a file

New requirements:

- Storing records of university employees for work: name, surname, PESEL number, gender, address, earnings
- All persons, whether they are employees or students, are to be kept in one container
- Filling the database with artificial data
- Modification of earnings by searching for a person by PESEL number
- Sort by salary

## Instructions

To compile and run a program using CMake, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have CMake installed and a C++ compiler compliant with C++11 or later.
2. Clone the University-DB repository to your local computer.
3. Go to the project directory.
4. Execute the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

After successfully compiling, run the program.

```bash
./university-db
```

Launching the tests

```bash
./university-db-ut
```

Run with generated data - cleans and injects dummy data into the db

```bash
./university-db [--generate | -g]
```
## Usage examples

```cpp
// Add a new student
addStudent(newStudent);

// Display entire database
displayDatabase();

// Search by last name
searchByLastName("Kowalski");

// Search by PESEL number
searchByPESEL("88010101234");

// Sorting by PESEL number
sortByPESEL();

// Sort by last name
sortByLastName();

// Delete by PESEL
removeByPESEL("88060918688");

// Sort by salary
sortBySalary();

// Change in salary
changeSalary(100000, person);
```
